# Github Dev Finder

I made this small application as a practice project to develop my knowledge how to work with API. I also practiced JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills. Design of this application comes from challenge on frontendmentor.io. In this challenge you will be provided with some starter materials, such as texts and images and then you have to do all the codework.

## Objectives:

    - [x] User should view the optimal layout for the app depending on device's screen size
    - [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    - [x] Search for GitHub users by their username
    - [x] See relevant user information based on their search
    - [ ] Switch between light and dark themes
    - [ ] Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences

## My personal objectives:

    - [ ] Remake this app with React
    - [ ] Remake this app with Typescript instead of Javascript
